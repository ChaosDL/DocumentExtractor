Introduction

[Provide an introductory chapter, indicating if any parts of it are non-normative.]

1.1 Terminology

[The following is boilerplate. Most specifications will need this and the corresponding bibliography entry.] The key words must, must not, required, shall, shall not, should, should not, recommended, may, and optional in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2 Word Styles

[This section is provided to explain and demonstrate the styles available in the Word template attached to this sample document. It is important to use the styles provided in the template consistently and to avoid defining new styles or using raw formatting.

Delete this entire section when using this sample document to begin writing a new specification.]
2.1 Overall Style

The paper size is set to Letter, which is 8 ½ x 11. You may change this to A4 or whatever other size suits your needs.

The document identifier and publication date information in the footer needs to be updated every time you publish.

Line numbers are enabled by default for easy reference by specification commenters. You may turn line numbering off.

2.2 Title Page

The title page is designed to fit a lot of metadata compactly. If you wish to create a “true” title page, you may insert a page break after the subtitle.

2.3 Headings

Heading 1 through Heading 9 and AppendixHeading have been defined with a special appearance. Headings are numbered and appear in the Table of Contents. Pressing Return after a heading inserts a Normal paragraph style directly after.

This template sets Heading 1 and AppendixHeading to start on a new page. You may set the Heading 1 style not to start on a new page if you wish. Major headings have a horizontal rule above them.

2.4 Paragraphs

The font in the Normal paragraph style is 10-pt Arial. You may change this to 11-pt Times New Roman if you prefer a serif font; changing these two settings should change all the other relevant styles.

2.5 Lists

The Definition term and Definition paragraph styles are defined specially for this template. They produce a definition list with a hanging appearance. Pressing Return after one inserts the other directly after.

Definition term

Definition for the term.

Use List bullet for first-level bulleted lists. Use List bullet 2 for second-level bulleted lists. Use List continue for continued paragraphs in list items.

· List bullet

List continue.

· List bullet 2

List continue 2.

For bibliography lists, use the Ref paragraph style.  Use the Ref term character style for the bracketed text that serves as the bibliography entry key, and make each reference term into a bookmark for use as references from the text. For example, [RFC2119] is a generated cross-reference to the IETF RFC 2119 bibliography entry in Section 3.1 of this sample.

2.6 Tables

Use the following style for most tables: [To be supplied; suggestions welcome!]
2.7 Code Examples

For schema code and other normative code, use the Code paragraph style. It fits 71 characters. For example:

12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901

         1         2         3         4         5         6         7

<simpleType name="DecisionType">
    <restriction base="string">
        <enumeration value="Permit"/>
        <enumeration value="Deny"/>
        <enumeration value="Indeterminate"/>
    </restriction>
</simpleType>

Use the Code small style if the code has very long lines. It fits 80 characters. For example:

12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890

         1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8

<simpleType name="DecisionType">
    <restriction base="string">
        <enumeration value="Permit"/>
        <enumeration value="Deny"/>
        <enumeration value="Indeterminate"/>
    </restriction>
</simpleType>

For non-normative examples, use the Example paragraph style. For example:

GET http://<host name and path>?TARGET=<Target>...<HTTP-Version>

<other HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 components>

Use the Example small style if the example has very long lines. For example:

GET http://<host name and path>?TARGET=<Target>...<HTTP-Version>

<other HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 components>

2.8 Character Styles

This template defines several character styles for general text use:

· Element style (shortcut Ctrl-Shift-E) for <NativeElement> names and <ns:ForeignElement> names; add the angle brackets yourself

· Attribute style (shortcut Ctrl-Shift-A) for attributeNames
· Datatype style (shortcut Ctrl-Shift-Alt-D) for DataType names

· Keyword style (shortcut Ctrl-Shift-K) for OtherKeyword names

· Variable style (shortcut Ctrl-Shift-Alt-V) for variable names
